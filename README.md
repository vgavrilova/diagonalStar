# diagonalStar


Hello everyone!

This little program will help you to draw a diagonal star! You just have to insert a number greater than 5.
The patterns I've used for drawing asterisks while creating: <br>
<i>if row or column equals 1 <br>
   if row or column equals the inserted number<br>
   if row == column (diagonal: from top to bottom)<br>
   if column number equals (number - row + 1)</i><br>
   
   
   Have fun! <br>
   
  P.S. This is an exercise from Java course created by Tim Buchalka. That's why I've used a package here.
